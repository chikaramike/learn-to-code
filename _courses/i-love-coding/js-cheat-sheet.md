# JS Cheat Sheet

## Javascript Basics

Including JavaScript in an HTML Page

```js
<script type="text/javascript">
//JS code goes here 
</script>
```

Call an External JavaScript File

```js
<script src="myscript.js"></script><code></code>
```
Including Comments
```js
// Single line comments

/* Multi-line 
comments */
```


## Variables

var, const, let

var 

The most common variable. Can be reassigned but only accessed within a function. Variables defined with var move to the top when code is executed.

const

Cannot be reassigned and not accessible before they appear within the code.

let

Similar to const, however, let variable can be reassigned but not re-declared.

## Data Types

var age = 23 
// Numbers

var x
Variables

var a = "init"
Text (strings)

var b = 1 + 2 + 3
Operations

var c = true
True or false statements

const PI = 3.14
Constant numbers

var name = {firstName:"John", lastName:”Doe"}
Objects

## Objects

var person = { firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:20, nationality:"German" };

## Arrays

var fruit = ["Banana", "Apple", "Pear"];

## Array Methods

concat()
Join several arrays into one

indexOf()
Returns the first position at which a given element appears in an array

join()
Combine elements of an array into a single string and return the string

lastIndexOf()
Gives the last position at which a given element appears in an array

pop()
Removes the last element of an array

push()
Add a new element at the end

reverse()
Reverse the order of the elements in an array

shift()
Remove the first element of an array

slice()
Pulls a copy of a portion of an array into a new array

sort()
Sorts elements alphabetically

splice()
Adds elements in a specified way and position

toString()
Converts elements to strings

unshift()
Adds a new element to the beginning

valueOf()
Returns the primitive value of the specified object

## Operators

Basic Operators

+ Addition 
+ Subtraction 
+ Multiplication 
+ Division 
+ Grouping operator 
+ Modulus (remainder) 
+ Increment numbers 
+ Decrement numbers

### Comparison Operators

== Equal to 
=== Equal value and equal type
!= Not equal 
!== Not equal value or not equal type
> Greater than
< Less than
>= Greater than or equal to
<=  Less than or equal to
? Ternary operator

     
### Logical Operators

&& Logical and
|| Logical or
! Logical not

### Bitwise Operators

& AND statement 
| OR statement 
~ NOT 
^ XOR 
<< Left shift
>> Right shift
>>> Zero fill right shift

## Functions

function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) { // what the function does }

### Outputting Data

alert()
Output data in an alert box in the browser window

confirm()
Opens up a yes/no dialog and returns true/false depending on user click

console.log()
Writes information to the browser console, good for debugging purposes

document.write()
Write directly to the HTML document

prompt()
Creates an dialogue for user input

### Global Functions

decodeURI()
Decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) created by encodeURI or similar

decodeURIComponent()
Decodes a URI component

encodeURI()
Encodes a URI into UTF-8

encodeURIComponent()
Same but for URI components

eval()
Evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string

isFinite()
Determines whether a passed value is a finite number

isNaN()
Determines whether a value is NaN or not

Number()
Returns a number converted from its argument

parseFloat()
Parses an argument and returns a floating point number

parseInt()
Parses its argument and returns an integer

## Loops

for (before loop; condition for loop; execute after loop) { // what to do during the loop } for

The most common way to create a loop in Javascript

while

Sets up conditions under which a loop executes

do while

Similar to the while loop, however, it executes at least once and performs a check at the end to see if the condition is met to execute again

break

Used to stop and exit the cycle at certain conditions

continue

Skip parts of the cycle if certain conditions are met

## If - Else Statements

if (condition) { // what to do if condition is met } else {

of 7 24

// what to do if condition is not met }

## Strings

var person = "John Doe";

### Escape Characters

\' \" \\ \b \f \n \r \t

— Single quote — Double quote — Backslash — Backspace — Form feed — New line — Carriage return — Horizontal tabulator

\v

— Vertical tabulator

### String Methods

charAt()
Returns a character at a specified position inside a string

charCodeAt()
Gives you the unicode of character at that position

concat()
Concatenates (joins) two or more strings into one

fromCharCode()
Returns a string created from the specified sequence of UTF-16 code units

indexOf()
Provides the position of the first occurrence of a specified text within a string

lastIndexOf()
Same as indexOf() but with the last occurrence, searching backwards

match()
Retrieves the matches of a string against a search pattern

replace()
Find and replace specific text in a string

search()
Executes a search for a matching text and returns its position

slice()
Extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string

split()
Splits a string object into an array of strings at a specified position

substr()
Similar to slice() but extracts a substring depended on a specified number of characters

substring()
Also similar to slice() but can’t accept negative indices

toLowerCase()
Convert strings to lowercase

toUpperCase()
Convert strings to uppercase

valueOf()
Returns the primitive value (that has no properties or methods) of a string object
