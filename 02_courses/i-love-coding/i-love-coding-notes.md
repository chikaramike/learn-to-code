Function declaration / function statement 

function declaration is hoisted
function expressions only the var is hoisted, but does not get executed until later in the code. 

# Variables

Hoisting - javascript engine scans the code and declares variables

Function declarations are hoisted.  Function expressions are hoisted, but only the var name but is undefined.

# Scope

## Lesson 24

### Global Scope

### Functional scope
Any variables inside a function is in scope of the function

### Rule 
Variables outside can be accessed inside, but variables inside CANNOT be accessed outside - AKA private

### Scope Chain
The nested hierarchy of scope is called the scope chian.

### Lexical Environment (Lexical scope)
The physical locations (scope) where a variable or function is declared is it's lexical environment ( lexical scope)  

Variables are picked up from the lexical environment.

# Code formatting and coding ethics
## Code formatting
camelCase - variables, functions
Indenting - two spaces vs 4 spaces 
Use of space
code commenting
